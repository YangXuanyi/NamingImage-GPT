# NamingImage-GPT
## Project Description
NamingImage-GPT: A software for naming images based on ImageCaption and chatgpt. The software integrates OFA-Chinese and ChatGPT, and is interface packaged through PyQt5. It helps users summarize the main content of the image in the form of a name or a sentence. NamingImage-GPT can be widely used to annotate text data for ImageCaption projects and provide quick naming of images for office workers. In summary, it combines image caption and chatgpt to provide a new open source multi-modal understanding solution when the multi-modal GPT model has not yet been open source.
